# snakeGame
This program was designed to push the language of PL/B to it's limits and create a game out of a language that would never have a game made on it. This is a game of snake that runs on a hackjob of a gui I forced the language to create. It is a almost fully realized game of snake that includes a lot of bugs that I have yet to purge.
